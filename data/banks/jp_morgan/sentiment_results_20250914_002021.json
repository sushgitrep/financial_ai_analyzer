            "text": "Thank you very much and good morning, everyone. This quarter, the Firm reported net income of $15 billion, EPS of $5.24 on revenue of $45.7 billion, with an ROTCE of 21%. These results included an income tax benefit of $774 million, which we described in more detail in the earnings press release. On the next page, we have some more detail. The Firm reported revenue of $45.7 billion, down $5.3 billion, or 10% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was down $185 million or 1%, driven by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression, predominantly offset by higher wholesale deposits, higher revolving balances in Card, as well as the impact of securities activity, including from prior quarters. NIR ex. Markets was down $6.3 billion or 31%, and excluding the net gain related to Visa shares and net investment securities losses in the prior year, was up $1 billion or 8%, driven by higher asset management fees, higher auto lease income, higher investment banking fees, and higher Payments fees; and Markets revenue was up $1.1 billion, or 15%. Expenses of $23.8 billion were up $66 million; and excluding last year's Visa stock contribution to the Firm's foundation, was up $1.1 billion or 5%, primarily driven by compensation, higher brokerage and distribution fees, as well as higher auto lease depreciation. And credit costs were $2.8 billion, with net charge-offs of $2.4 billion and a net reserve build of $439 million. The build was driven by new lending activity, largely offset by a decrease in the probabilities that we attached to the adverse scenarios in the allowance estimation. On to the balance sheet on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, down 40 basis points versus the prior quarter, as net income was more than offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter's higher RWA is primarily driven by an increase in wholesale lending across both CIB Markets and Banking, and increase in other Markets activity, as well as an increase in Card loans. As you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago. Under the current rules, our indicative SCB is floored at 2.5% and goes into effect in 4Q25. Our new SCB also reflects the Board's intention to increase the dividend to $1.50 per share in the third quarter."

CCB reported net income of $5.2 billion on revenue of $18.8 billion, which was up 6% year- on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 3%, largely driven by growth in Wealth Management revenue with deposit NII relatively flat. Average deposits were down 1% year-on-year and flat sequentially. Client investment assets were up 14% year-on-year, driven by market performance and continued healthy flows into managed products. In Home Lending, revenue was down 5% year-on-year, predominantly driven by lower NII. Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 15% year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances, as well as higher operating lease income in Auto. Card outstandings were up 9% due to strong account acquisition. In Auto, originations were up 5%, driven by higher lease volume. Expenses of $9.9 billion were up 5% year-on-year, largely driven by growth in technology and auto lease depreciation. Credit costs were $2.1 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion, relatively flat year-on-year, in line with expectations. Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $6.7 billion on revenue of $19.5 billion, which was up 9% year-on-year. IB fees were up 7% year-on-year. We continue to rank number 1 with wallet share of 8.9%. In Advisory, fees were up 8%, benefiting from increased sponsor activity. Debt underwriting fees were up 12%, primarily driven by a few large deals. In equity underwriting, fees were down 6% year-on- year. Our pipeline remains robust, and the outlook, along with the market tone and sentiment, is notably more upbeat. Payments revenue was up 3% year-on-year, excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, predominantly offset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was down 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher losses on hedges. Moving to Markets, total revenue was up 15% year-on-year. Fixed Income was up 14%, with improved performance in Currencies & Emerging Markets, Rates and Commodities. This was partially offset by fewer opportunities in Securitized Products and Fixed Income Financing."

We continue to see strong performance across products, most notably in Derivatives. Securities Services revenue was up 12% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth. Expenses of $9.6 billion were up 5% year-on-year, driven by higher compensation, brokerage and technology expense, partially offset by lower legal expense. Average Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and up 2% quarter-on-quarter, with sequential growth primarily driven by new loans with larger corporates. Average client deposits were up 16% year-on-year and up 5% sequentially, reflecting increased activity across Payments and Securities Services. Finally, credit costs were $696 million, driven by builds in our C&I portfolio, including new lending activity and downgrades to a handful of names, partially offset by the scenario probability adjustment I mentioned upfront. Turning to Asset & Wealth Management to complete our lines of business. AWM reported net income of $1.5 billion with pre-tax margin of 34%. Revenue of $5.8 billion was up 10% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, as well as higher brokerage activity and higher deposit balances. Expenses of $3.7 billion, were up 5% year-on-year, driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation, and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $31 billion for the quarter, led by Fixed Income and Equities. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $5 billion. AUM of $4.3 trillion was up 18% year-on-year, and client assets of $6.4 trillion were up 19% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 7% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. Turning to Corporate. Corporate reported net income of $1.7 billion and includes the tax item I mentioned upfront. Revenue was $1.5 billion for the quarter. NII was $1.5 billion, down $875 million year-on-year."

Expenses, $547 million, were down $32 million year-on-year, excluding the Foundation contribution from the prior year that I mentioned earlier. To finish up, I'll touch on the outlook. You'll recall that at Investor Day, I made a couple of comments previewing the potential evolution of the outlook. So now, let me formalize that and give you updated guidance. First, we now expect NII ex. Markets to be approximately $92 billion, with the increase driven by changes in the forward curve and strong deposit growth in Payments, Securities Services as well as balanced growth in Card. Total NII guidance is now about $95.5 billion, implying $3.5 billion of Markets NII. Second, on adjusted expense, we now expect it to be about $95.5 billion, primarily driven by the impact of the weaker dollar, which is largely bottom line neutral. And finally, on credit, we continue to expect the Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.6%. So reflecting on the quarter, while the environment remains extremely dynamic, in many ways navigating uncertainty is the norm for both us and our clients.

            "text": "Let me take the second part of that first. So, we have our centered capital hierarchy that we recite a lot, and I don't want to bore you by reciting it again. But I think it's important because it does serve as a guide in this context, right? So, we deploy our capital against organic and inorganic growth, and we ensure a sustainable dividend. And with what's left, we do buybacks. And so, we've talked about how excess capital's earnings in store. You saw this quarter that we actually had some financial resource usage that came through and actually meant that, despite keeping the buybacks relatively constant and having the organic capital generation be relatively constant, the CET1 ratio dropped a little bit as a function of increased usage organically showing up in RWA expansion. So, we're doing what we want to do. But clearly, it is a big amount of excess and that does mean that everything is on the table as it always is, and that includes potentially inorganic things. Now, obviously, that needs to be done carefully. I think acquisitions have a high bar, both financially, strategically, and importantly, in some cases, culturally. And we also need to think carefully about things that work outside the regulated perimeter, might not work inside the regulated perimeter as well. We have learned some lessons. We don't want to overlearn those lessons. But in the end, sometimes we lean in a little more, sometimes we lean in a little less, but we wouldn't be doing our jobs if we weren't thinking about it. I don't particularly think, other than fundamentally whether things are permissible or not, that the regulatory environment right now, particularly shapes our thinking on that front."

I will note that Vice Chair Bowman, gave a speech on her vision having come into the new seat for ongoing work and regulation. And I think it's a speech that's pretty comprehensive and lays out some of what Jamie is saying in terms of like the to-do list. I think at the margin, we do understand the desire to sort of knock some things off the to-do list that have been on it for a long time and clearly need to be addressed like SLR. But at the same time that that happens, the holistic review done properly across not only capital, but also liquidity, resolution, et cetera, is clearly quite important. More narrowly, in the near term, I think we continue to feel very strongly that of all the things that are out there, one of the worst is G-SIB, in the sense of both the original gold plating, the sort of deep conceptual flaws in the framework itself, and the failure to recalibrate it for growth since it was put into effect. And I think one of the things that's maybe a little bit underdiscussed there is the extent to which it specifically creates strong disincentives for American banks to be strong and globally competitive. And that is, it seems to me, the exact opposite of what we want. So, that's really one of the ones that needs to get attacked pretty aggressively, I would say."

Now, it is true that if you look at not our data, but the government's data, I think I was looking at this the other day like, first half real consumer spending of this year versus second half of last year is down. Now, it's still positive, it's still growing, but it's down. So it's kind of consistent, this sort of soft landing narrative, which is also consistent with the sort of the GDP outlook that our economists are publishing. Our own data looked sort of in nominal terms on a cohort basis, actually shows spending up a little bit over the same period. So, it's kind of the same narrative of things being fine with different signals pointing in slightly different directions, but nothing particularly concerning."

That part of the franchise remains fine, but sort of muted as customers have access to capital markets and revolver utilization is sort of flattish in general.

You may recall, I actually got a version of this question at Investor Day, so I'll almost repeat my answer here which is that, as we know, fixing SLR has been on the list for a long time. It behaved very much not the way it was designed in the moment of big QE when it became binding and it had bad impacts on the system. It's the opposite of what we want for these backstop measures. And so, we don't want regulators to need to make unusual corrections amid crisis. It's just not the right way to run the railroad. I think everyone has agreed on that for a long time. And in that context, it's been sort of disappointing that something as obvious as this has taken as long as this to get fixed, but it's a good sign that it's now out there. And we\u2019d certainly support the proposal, there are some nuances that \u2013 or a comment had been requested, but at a high level, it's a good proposal, it's the right thing to do. And it's the right thing to do from the perspective of the resilience of the system for the next time that we've got that type of expansion in the size of the system that could make it binding in the wrong way for the wrong reasons. But yeah, as you note and as we've said, we're not really bound by it. I think other actors in the market may be a little bit more bound by it. There are also some nuances about impact on portfolio activity which I would expect to be very small, versus impact on low risk intermediation in the market making businesses, which may be where you would hope to see the effect. So, it's a good thing. Hopefully, it will help. Obviously, it's pretty fully priced in at this point, so I don't think you're going to see a big pop one way or the other as a function of it's eventually being finalized, because I think everyone's assuming it will go in roughly in its current form."

We've talked over time about the Markets revenues and the dramatic increase. Obviously, 2019 is a long time ago at this point, and we should expect those revenues to grow with GDP anyway, but we worried a lot in certain moments about the revenues dropping back to some old run rate, and then we kind of stopped worrying about that. And now, of course, they've gone up to new highs, so maybe we should be worried again. But a thing I like to remind myself of, to your point is that, while the revenues have gone up a lot, the resource usage has also gone up a lot. So, we are deploying a lot of capital and other resources in this business, and we're earning good returns on it, but the revenue growth is not coming for free.

Let me say what I mean. Like, on the one hand, I think if you look at the current market environment, it's hard to imagine a set of conditions that would be any better for us, right. Rates are at a good level for us, deal activity is high, capital markets are very strong, consumer credit is excellent, wholesale credit is excellent, wealth management, asset management, essentially every part of the company is firing. We're essentially firing on all cylinders, with some very minor exceptions of certain businesses that are extremely rate sensitive, like Home Lending, where they're still doing a great job in what is a very tough market. So when you see that, you're like, well, that's not normal. Normally, you would have some pockets doing a little better, some pockets doing a little worse; and that's part of what makes you think that some aspects of this are maybe not sustainable. On the other hand, it's also true that core elements of the strategy are working very well, and we've been investing for a long time very successfully and kind of leaning in even in moments where from the outside there wasn't that much appetite for us to be investing in all of the things that Jamie's talking about.

But if you look at SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III, FSRT, the overlap, the duplication, I actually believe that you can make the system simpler, cheaper, more effective, more transparent and safer. And the things like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic did not need to happen if you just modify some things and you create more liquidity, more loans and a safer system. And that's really what they should be looking at, not just SLR. And so, I'm hoping that over time they do that. And the second thing I'd add to that which I think is even maybe more important is, they should ask the question, what do they actually want in our public markets versus our private markets, et cetera. We've gone from 8,000 public companies, I'm talking about like 25 years ago, to 4,000 today. That's happened overseas. Public markets overseas have gotten smaller and smaller. Obviously, I'm not against private credit; private credit is growing. And how do you really want to structure this? And why is it happening? Is that a good thing for America?"

And that's a nice number; and as you've written, that would produce some nice revenue consequences, all else being equal. The way I think about that number is to kind of build it up step-by-step. So, you start with, in general, the consumer deposit base in the system has grown probably slightly above nominal GDP. A thing that's been true for us recently is that as a result of our market position and our pricing choices, we've probably lost a little bit of share during the rate hiking cycle sort of in isolation from yield seeking flows. With the yield seeking flows having abated a little bit, that relative headwind is kind of behind us or increasingly behind us, and you've got some core growth reasserting itself. You saw us call out the growth in net new accounts in consumer checking this quarter, and that's one of the key drivers. And then, as you know well, when you look at the franchise, we kind of have: number one, ongoing expansion; number two, seasoning of the old expansion; and number three, deepening in the core markets. So when you put all that together and you look at sort of the history of the growth, macro environment, et cetera, that's how you get to that type of 6% number. And obviously, things could change quite dramatically to produce a different number, among other things. You'll recall that Marianne's slide also talked about a stress scenario with lower rates which, perhaps somewhat non-intuitively, would produce actually higher growth as a result of even less yield seeking flow and a higher consumer savings rate. But the flip side of that is also true which is, an unexpectedly high rate environment would probably lead to lower balance growth, all else equal, in Consumer. So, we like to say, those are all else being equal type numbers, but all else is never equal."

So, I think you should do them and reduce risk in the system. I'm only going to talk about how they increase lending for a second. And so, G-SIFI inhibits, if you look at it, both a little bit of lending and a little bit of market making. LCR inhibits both because it's a very rigid way of looking at a bank\u2019s balance sheet. It doesn't really give you credit for potential access to window and things like that. CCAR in some cases inhibit \u2013 people \u2013 we talk about \u2018CCAR-ness,\u2019 but there's a lot of \u2018CCAR-ness\u2019 from small business loans and stuff like that where people kind of hold that back a little bit because it creates too much volatility. And CCAR capital, the FSRT, the fundamental book. When you look at all these things, I think you can create more lending, more liquidity, more flexibility and reduce the risk in the system. And also just CET, just capital usage, et cetera. And the reducing the risk in the system, I think you also make it friendlier for community banks, which we do want to do. And so, if you look at like total loan to deposits, they used to be 100%, they\u2019re now 70%. That's a huge difference. That took place over 10 or 15 years. And can you get that back to 85% and have the banking system be just safe and sound? Absolutely."

There is a ton of dry powder. So I'm curious if there's a higher level of confidence, meaning if the market doesn't take from us, is it really happening this time?

Obviously, you had a very strong number this quarter, 20% when you adjusted for the one-time effect. And you go back to your Investor Day and you pointed out 17% is what the targeted level is. And if you turn back the clock and go back to 2020, you had the same 17% goal for the ROTCE, but your CET1 ratio back then was \u2013 excuse me, guidance was 11.5% to 12%. So my question is, has the business for you folks changed so much that now it's just inherently a more profitable business? Or are there some one-time \u2013 not one-time items, but are there some tailwinds that are artificially \u2013 I hate to use that word, but are they inflating the ROTCE which is why you guys are very cautious about lifting that goal from 17%?"
